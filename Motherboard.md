# Motherboard

## What It Does  
The motherboard connects all your PC components, allowing them to work together. Think of it as the body that holds the brain (CPU) and heart (GPU).

## Important Terms  
- **Socket Type:** A specific shape that matches your CPU. For example, AMD CPUs use AM5 sockets, while Intel uses LGA 1700.  
- **Chipset:** Determines features like overclocking (making your CPU run faster) and USB speeds.  
- **Form Factor:** The size of the motherboard. Common sizes are ATX (large), Micro-ATX (medium), and Mini-ITX (small).

## How to Choose  
- Match the socket type to your CPU.  
- Pick a form factor that fits your case.  
- Choose a motherboard with enough ports for your devices (like USBs, storage drives, and GPUs).
