# GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)

## What It Does  
The GPU is responsible for creating images, videos, and 3D graphics. Itâ€™s essential for gaming, video editing, and tasks that require visuals.

## Important Terms  
- **VRAM:** Like RAM for your GPU, it helps store temporary visual data. More VRAM is better for gaming and editing.  
- **Resolution:** Higher resolutions (like 4K) need more powerful GPUs.

## How to Choose  
- Gamers should focus on GPUs with 6GB or more VRAM for smooth gameplay.  
- Creators (video editors, animators) should consider GPUs designed for productivity (like NVIDIA RTX cards).  
- Check that the GPU will physically fit in your case and is compatible with your motherboard.
