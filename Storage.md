# Storage

## What It Does  
Storage holds your files, programs, and operating system. There are two main types: HDDs and SSDs.

## Important Terms  
- **HDD (Hard Drive):** Cheaper, slower, and good for large files.  
- **SSD (Solid-State Drive):** Faster, quieter, and better for your operating system and apps.  
- **NVMe SSD:** The fastest SSD type, ideal for gamers and creators.

## How to Choose  
- Use an SSD for your operating system and programs.  
- Use an HDD for storing large files like photos and videos.  
- Ensure your motherboard supports the storage type you pick (SATA for HDDs, NVMe for fast SSDs).
