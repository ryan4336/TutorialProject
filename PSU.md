# Power Supply Unit (PSU)

## What It Does  
The PSU powers all your components. Think of it as the engine that drives your PC.

## Important Terms  
- **Wattage:** The total power output. Youâ€™ll need more wattage for high-performance parts.  
- **Efficiency:** Look for ratings like 80+ Bronze, Gold, or Platinum. Higher ratings mean less wasted power.  
- **Modular:** Lets you connect only the cables you need for a cleaner setup.

## How to Choose  
- Use an online calculator to estimate your wattage needs.  
- Choose a PSU with slightly more wattage than required.  
- Ensure it fits in your case and has the right connectors for your parts.
