# CPU (Central Processing Unit)

## What It Does  
The CPU is the brain of the computer. It processes all the instructions your computer receives, like running programs or calculating numbers. A faster CPU means your computer can handle more tasks quickly.

## Important Terms  
- **Cores:** Think of cores as workers. More cores mean the CPU can handle more tasks at once.  
- **Clock Speed:** Measured in GHz, it shows how fast each core can work. Higher speeds are better for demanding tasks like gaming.

## How to Choose  
- If you're gaming, look for CPUs with at least 6 cores and high clock speeds.  
- For general use (like browsing or writing), 4 cores are usually enough.  
- Choose a CPU brand (AMD or Intel) based on your budget and compatibility with the motherboard.
